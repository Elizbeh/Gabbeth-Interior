## About The Developer

I'm Elizabeth Behaghel, a dedicated software engineering student with a passion for building dynamic and innovative web applications. I'm in the process of mastering a wide range of web development tools and technologies.

## Project Description

Gabbeth Interiors is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack e-commerce project that showcases my journey in learning web development. As a software engineering student, I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of the entire development process, from front-end to back-end. The project includes features such as user registration, product management, shopping cart functionality, and payment processing. It also provides real-time notifications and an admin dashboard for managing products, users, and orders.

## Story of Development

I started this project with a clear goal in mind: to create a complex e-commerce application that showcases the interaction between data and users. The journey was a blend of curiosity, learning, and determination. I used project management tools like Trello to organize my tasks and timelines, which proved to be highly effective. It helped me stay on track, with most of my estimated timelines being met.

The challenges I faced were numerous, as I am still a student learning the ropes of web development. One of the most daunting tasks was integrating Cloudinary and Redux Toolkit into the project. Initially, I wasn't familiar with Redux DevTools, which made it challenging to debug my application's state changes. However, over time, I became more comfortable with these tools, making the development workflow more efficient.

Another significant challenge was resolving issues related to MongoDB connections. I dedicated substantial time to searching for solutions on the internet, particularly on platforms like Stack Overflow. These challenges helped me develop problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of the technologies used.

## Implemented Features
